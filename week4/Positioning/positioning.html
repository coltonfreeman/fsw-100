<!--Create a website that contains the following:

A fixed horizontal navbar (meaning it is always on the top of the page, even if you scroll down).
A blog-style feed, where each blog post is in the center of the page, and as you scroll down the page, it shows older blog posts. (Note: The blog posts' content can just be hard-coded, meaning it'll all just be on a single page and you can just put filler text (lorem ipsum)).
Each blog post should have a title of some kind.
Each blog post should have the date it was "published".
Each blog post should have a photo of some kind near the top of the text, and the text should wrap around the photo and have a reasonable margin between the photo and the wrapped text-->

                                <p class="blogPost"><p>Bevo is the live mascot of the athletic programs at the University of Texas at Austin. Bevo is a Texas Longhorn steer with burnt orange and white coloring from which the university derived its color scheme. The current mascot's horn span is 58" and weighs 1800lbs. The profile of the Longhorn's head and horns gives rise to the school's hand symbol and saying: "Hook 'em Horns". The most recent Bevo, Bevo XV, was introduced to Texas football fans on September 4, 2016. His predecessor, Bevo XIV, died of cancer on October 16, 2015. Bevo XV is owned by Betty and John Baker's Sunrise Ranch in Liberty Hill, Texas; Sunrise Ranch also owned Bevo XV's predecessors Bevo XIII and Bevo XIV.</p>

                            <h5 class="blogDate">Founded in 1893</h5>
                            <p class="blogPost"><p>Beginning in 1893, the Texas Longhorns football program is one of the most highly regarded and historic programs of all time. From 1936 to 1946 the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Dana X. Bible, and then from 1957 to 1976 the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Darrell K Royal, who won three national championships. The first championship was in 1963 and the second was in 1969. In 2009, ESPN ranked Texas as the seventh-most prestigious college football program since 1936. In 2012, the football program was valued at $805 million, more than the calculated value of several NFL teams. Texas is known for their post-season appearances, ranking second in number of bowl game appearances, fourth in bowl game victories, most Southwest Conference football championships (27), and most Cotton Bowl Classic appearances[11] and victories. Other NCAA records include 108 winning seasons out of 122 total seasons, 24 seasons with 10 or more wins, 9 undefeated seasons, and 26 seasons with at most one loss or tie. From 1936 to 2012, the Longhorns football teams have been in the AP or coaches' rankings 66 out of 76 seasons (86.8% of the time), finishing those seasons ranked in the top twenty-five 48 times and the top ten 28 times. Texas claims four Division I-A national championships (1963, 1969, 1970 and 2005) and 32 conference championships (3 Big 12 Conference, 27 Southwest Conference, and 2 Texas Intercollegiate6 Athletic Association).</p>

                            <p class="blogPost"><p>Head cheerleader Harley Clark helped create the Hook 'em Horns hand symbol in 1955 by demonstrating it at a pep rally before the TCU game. He and roommate H.K. Pitts developed the sign the night before by experimenting but I mean with shadow puppets. Texas lost the game but gained a new tradition</p>
